					<h4>1960</h4>
					<h3>After WWII</h3>
					<p>In this project, I use blue to represent senior population, which means people above 65 years old. For the young, which means people between 15 and 64 years old, I choose red. In this case, the warmer a country's color is, the younger its average age is. On the contrast, a cooler color represents an older demographic.
                      </p>
                    
                       <p> This is 1996, from the map, we can see most countries face a lost of young people. My assumption is the war killed many young people. 
                    </p>
                     <p> Ater this period is the 60s baby boom.

					<h4>1970</h4>
					<h3>Young People Fight For A Liberal World</h3>
<p>20 more years after the war, a large group of young people finally become the leading role of the world. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The 1970s were a tumultuous time. In some ways, the decade was a continuation of the 1960s. Women, African Americans, Native Americans, gays and lesbians and other marginalized people continued their fight for equality, and many Americans joined the protest against the ongoing war in Vietnam. In other ways, however, the decade was a repudiation of the 1960s. A “New Right” mobilized in defense of political conservatism and traditional family roles, and the behavior of President Richard Nixon undermined many people’s faith in the good intentions of the federal government. By the end of the decade, these divisions and disappointments had set a tone for public life that many would argue is still with us today. </p>				</div>

					<h4>1980</h4>
					<h3>Lower Birth Rate</h3>
					<p>1980 is the year when the global burth rate started to slow down. </p>
                    <p>This has a far influence on the world demographic after 20 years. From the later maps, we can see that after 2000, some areas back into pure blue color, which means they are facing an aging society.  </p>

					<h4>1990</h4>
					<h3>A Gradually Aging World</h3>
<p>Most countries began to turn blue! Including Europe, Asia and north America. </p>	
                    <p>However, interesting things is that the Afica is always a land of warm color, which means the demographic of Africa is relatively younger than any other areas. My understanding is the average life length of African is shorter than the other areas. Actually I found anouther data to prove this hypothesis. The average life lengths of most African countries are below 65. On the contrast, the everage life span of Japanese is 81.    </p>

					<h4>2000</h4>
					<h3>Less Baby</h3>
					<p>When we look at the map, don't forget there is another group which is not shown here, the babies and youth, which age from 0 to 14. Started from 1980, people in developed countries shifted their mind of having babies. This phenomenon is countinuing still.
                    </p>From the map, we can see in these developed countries, both senior and young working population is growing, but the 0-14 population is declining.

				<h4>2016</h4>
					<h3>Prepare for A Blue World</h3>
					<p>We can predict from the map that in the following decades, countries like Norway, France will face serious population aging. These countries have both high senior population and high working population, which means the upcoming young generation' s population is quite low.
                    </p>
                    <p>Countries like China, Brazil, which benefited a lot from the young working power in the past fifty years will face a turning point when these people turn into their senior age.  </p>				</div>

							<h2>Why I do this?</h2>
							<p>I want to show that the aging society is the new reality in the following 20 or 30 years. No matter what kind of country it is. Countries like France, Norway, development of economy and medical techniche development lead to a senior society. In countries like China, government intervention leads to unhealthy population structure.  
                            </p>	
                            <p>How can we as designer design for an aging world? That is the question I am always thinking. If you have a same interest or have some ideas, let's talk!
